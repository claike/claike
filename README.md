### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly keep things on GitLab and my own Giteaâ€¦  
â€¦ and my own cumpewter because I'm too lazy to do
```bash
git remote add remote SOME_PLACE_ON_THE_INTERNET
git push -u remote
```

You can check my [***XxX_WeB_SiTe_XxX***](https://nasrally.xyz) for contact information  
(it is quite common for it to be down, I host it on my own hardware)
